This app is the result of my successful completion of this project/part of the 'Android Basics in Kotlin' course. I used starter code provided by Google Developer Training resources and then wrote additional code in Kotlin to make the app functional. You can find the course at this link: https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/course

# Bus Scheduler App

This folder contains the source code for the Bus Scheduler app codelab.

# Introduction
The Bus Scheduler app displays a list of bus stops and arrival times. Tapping a bus stop on the first screen will display a list of all arrival times for that particular stop.

The bus stops are stored in a Room database. Schedule items are represented by the `Schedule` class and queries on the data table are made by the `ScheduleDao` class. The app includes a view model to access the `ScheduleDao` and format data to be display in a list, using `Flow` to send data to a recycler view adapter.

# Pre-requisites
* Experience with Kotlin syntax.
* Familiarity with activities, fragments, and recycler views.
* Basic knowledge of SQL databases and performing basic queries.

# Getting Started
1. Install Android Studio, if you don't already have it.
2. Download the sample.
3. Import the sample into Android Studio.
4. Build and run the sample.
